  <h2>Analysis</h2>
  <p>The above maps provide awarness about the connections between environmental disparities, redlining, and the disproportionate impact of pollution on marginalized communities, including tribal areas. In many instances, there is a correlation between high levels of ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM) pollution in areas that were historically deemed "undesirable" during the practice of redlining. This correlation is a result of various systemic factors:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Historical Redlining</b>: Redlining was a discriminatory practice in the United States that denied financial services and investment to neighborhoods with predominantly non-white or low-income residents. These areas often had limited resources and were denied access to infrastructure improvements, including clean energy and transportation.</li>
    <li><b>Limited Green Spaces</b>: Redlined neighborhoods typically lacked parks, green spaces, and tree cover. These areas had fewer trees and vegetation, leading to reduced natural filtration of air pollutants like ozone.</li>
    <li><b>Proximity to Industrial Zones</b>: Redlined areas were often located near industrial zones and highways, where emissions of pollutants like ozone precursors (nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds) and PM were high due to manufacturing and transportation activities.</li>
    <li><b>Limited Healthcare Access</b>: Residents in redlined neighborhoods often had limited access to healthcare services, making them more vulnerable to the health impacts of air pollution.</li>
    <li><b>Disinvestment</b>: Redlining resulted in economic disinvestment in these communities, leading to substandard housing conditions, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of political power to advocate for environmental improvements.</li>
    <li><b>Tribal Areas</b>: Tribal communities, too, have historically faced environmental injustice. They often live near polluting industries, mines, or areas with poor air quality, compounding the health risks associated with ozone and PM exposure.</li>
    <li><b>Climate Change</b>: Ozone levels are also influenced by climate change, as higher temperatures can lead to increased ozone formation. Many marginalized communities are disproportionately affected by climate change due to their limited resources and vulnerability to extreme weather events.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The correlation between high ozone and PM levels in these redlined and tribal areas exacerbates the environmental injustice these communities face. Exposure to high levels of ozone and PM is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, which can have severe health consequences, especially for vulnerable populations.</p>
